# VLSI-Design

A comprehensive resource for VLSI Design(LTspice, Quartus, GTKwave, Note++), featuring RTL coding, synthesis, simulation, and verification. This repository includes project files, scripts, and methodologies for designing and implementing digital systems using Verilog/VHDL, SPICE, and other VLSI tools.

For Human detection device
This project is to design a Human Tracking Device using Verilog. This device counts the number of people entering a room, displays the total on a 7-segment display, and triggers an alarm when the count exceeds 80. The design was compiled using Quartus II 13.1 Web Edition and simulated using Iverilog and GTKWave. Hereâ€™s the simulation process; 
1.Compiled the Verilog files using the following command.
 iverilog -o my_htd htd_tb.v htd.v 
2. After compilation, run the simulation with the command.
 	vvp my_htd 
3.The simulation generated a .vcd file (human_detection.vcd), which can open with GTKWave. 
  gtkwave human_detection.vcd  

On FPGA Design and Compilation with Quartus II 13.1. First, open Quartus II 13.1 Web Edition and create a new project for the (human_counter). Then, add the RTL code (htd.v) to the project. The design was compiled using Quartus II.(###Check the module name before creating the QuartusII)
